# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reorder the header navigation so “About Us” appears immediately after “Industries We Serve” on both desktop and mobile.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the shared top-level navigation configuration to place “About Us” directly after “Industries We Serve” (before “Contact Us”).
- Ensure the mobile menu uses the same top-level ordering as the desktop header.

**User-visible outcome:** The site header and mobile menu display the top-level navigation in this order: Home, Our Solutions, Industries We Serve, About Us, Contact Us, with all links and behaviors unchanged.
