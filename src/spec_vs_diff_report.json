  "summary": "Implemented a new hover-region tracking hook and updated SiteHeader to use a single controlled openDropdownId with hover-to-open behavior (at least for the shown “solutions” dropdown), including logic to keep the dropdown open while the pointer is over the trigger or the portal-rendered panel. However, due to truncation, it’s not fully verifiable that *all* top-level items with children were updated to the same behavior. Also, some repository metadata/summary files were changed in ways not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Apply hover-open + keep-open-until-pointer-leaves-trigger-and-panel behavior to each top-level desktop header menu item that has children (not just a single special-cased item).",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows the new hover behavior and hover-region hook wired for a special-cased \"Our Solutions\" item (item.id === 'solutions'), but the remainder of SiteHeader.tsx is truncated, so there is no clear evidence that every other top-level item with children uses the same controlled open state + hover-region handling.",
