  "summary": "Implemented centralized industry theme mapping and applied primary/background styling to ContentPage with CSS-variable driven link/section styling. Added BrandLogo component with onError text fallback and wired it into header/footer. However, accent_color is not actually used in styling, and the required placeholder logo asset under frontend/public is not shown in the diff. Also, global theme tokens in index.css were modified beyond industry-only theming needs.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "For industries that specify an accent_color (Manufacturing and Banking), the accent color is used as an optional secondary highlight (e.g., subtle badge/underline/divider) without replacing the primary color usage.",
      "reason": "The diff sets the CSS variable --industry-accent in ContentPage when accent_color exists, but there is no CSS or component styling that references --industry-accent to create a visible secondary highlight.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Add (or regenerate) a clean corporate wordmark placeholder logo image matching the existing configured logo path under frontend/public.",
      "reason": "No static asset addition under frontend/public is present in the diff summary; only a React component fallback to text is added.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly focuses on per-industry theming and warns not to change non-industry page themes beyond what’s necessary. The diff modifies global color tokens in index.css, which affects the entire site, not just industry pages.",
