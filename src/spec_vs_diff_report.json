  "summary": "The diff implements a new /solutions landing page with per-category anchored sections sourced from navigation + solutionServices, and adds scroll-sync state via context so the SiteHeader “Our Solutions” dropdown reflects the active category while scrolling on /solutions and resets when navigating away.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added a dedicated hero/banner section to the /solutions landing page (background image via resolvePageBanner, gradient hero styling) beyond the stated scroll-sync and section/list requirements.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest did not ask for a hero/banner redesign; only required 6 scrollable sections and header scroll-sync behavior.",
