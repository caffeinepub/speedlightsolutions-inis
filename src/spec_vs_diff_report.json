  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via updates to the navigation configuration for the “Industries We Serve” dropdown. REQ-2 cannot be verified from the provided (truncated) diff content for pages.ts; additionally, unrelated content/navigation helper/state-summary changes appear in the diff that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "Ensure both desktop dropdown and mobile navigation render the same 10 industry labels and navigate correctly.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the updated labels/routes in the shared navigation config, but does not include evidence of how the mobile navigation consumes this config or renders labels/links; no header/mobile component diff is provided.",

      "reason": "frontend/src/content/pages.ts is truncated and the visible portion only shows updates to solution pages; the diff snippet does not show the 10 industry page entries or the required block structure/ordering/CTA links, so implementation cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
