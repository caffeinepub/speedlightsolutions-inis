HomePage.tsx shows a new structured data-driven layout for multiple sections, but the diff is truncated, so full verification of all required sections and exact character-for-character text usage is not possible. Some non-requested/possibly non-provided copy appears in HomePage (page title string and an extra section intro sentence).",
